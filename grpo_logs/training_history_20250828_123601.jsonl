I will walk you through the process of creating the SQL query for this task.\n\nFirst, let's examine the table structure:\n- **Result**: This could represent the outcome of the match (e.g., win, lose, draw).\n- **Opponent**: This column likely contains information about the opponent.\n- **Method**: This column specifies the method of victory (e.g., decision, submission, etc.).\n- **Event**: This might be details about the event where the match occurred.\n- **Notes**: This column could contain additional information or special notes.\n\nTo find the Notes where the Method is 'decision', we need to select the `Notes` column from the table where the `Method` column equals 'decision'.\n\nThe SQL query for this would be:\n```sql\nSELECT Notes FROM Jiu_Jitsu_Championships_Results WHERE Method = 'decision';\n```\n\nNow, I will execute this query for you.
