Specifically:\n- 2007: sf (likely meaning 'semi-final')\n- 2008: f (likely meaning 'final')\n\n### Thought Process\n1. Identify the table: The table name is \"Tournament Results\".\n2. Identify the columns: The years (2007, 2008, 2010) are the column headers.\n3. Formulate the SQL query:\n   - We need to find the Tournament name where the 2007 column has 'sf'.\n   - We need to verify that the 2008 column has 'f'.\n   - We need to ensure the 2010 column has 'f'.\n4. The SQL query should use a WHERE clause to filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\n### SQL Query Construction\nLet's construct the SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT Tournament FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2007` = 'sf' AND `2008` = 'f' AND `2010` = 'f';\n```\n\n### Action: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT Tournament FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2007` = 'sf' AND `2008` = 'f' AND `2010` = 'f';\n```\n\nExecute the above SQL and wait for the output.",

Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then write down:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\nDO NOT write this pattern unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself.\n\n\nAssistant: Ok.\n\nUser: What in 2007 has a 2008 of sf, and a 2010 of f?\nThe name of this table is Tournament Results, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,Win %.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
